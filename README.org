** Coderkid-cli
    
   /Coderkid-cli/ is the command line interface for [[http://coderkid.com][coderkid.com]]
    
    I aim for this to be an easy way to learn all of the various topics I have on coderkid.com, and and easy interface for testing one's ability.
    
* Inspiration

   Much of this project was influenced by [[https://exercism.io][exercism.io]].

   Despite saying this, I had originally come up with this idea before ever being reminded of exercism's handy command-line tool, however, after I began writing this program, I looked to exercism's own implementation for pointers.
   I borrowed much of their program design.

   (Not including using Go, that was always going to happen).
